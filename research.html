            <p>I have been conducting research in the Guerrero Lab since the beginning of my sophomore year. My research is in population genetics, and utilizes computerized modeling to generate data that I then analyze to draw conclusions. In my research, I work with a postdoctoral mentor to explore a scenario in which non-Mendelian segregation in females causes non-Mendelian assortment of unlinked alleles in males. Under typical Mendelian genetics, alleles at one locus segregate with equal probability and alleles at different loci are sorted independently into gametes. Exceptions to these laws occur in the form of meiotic drive and linkage, respectively. To achieve biased segregation, three types of asymmetry exist within the female meiotic mechanism: 1) centromere heterozygosity, where the centromere of each chromosome can vary by size or by the presence of neocentromeres. 2) polar body formation in which only one of the meiotic products contributes its alleles to the germline. 3) spindle asymmetry during meiosis which biases centromere orientation at the spindle poles. In males, presence of this meiotic spindle asymmetry can similarly force driver alleles with large centromeres to orient at a specific pole, leading to biased formation of two certain haplotypes (double driver or double dragger). This concept is visualized in the artifact above. We model the effect of sex differences in meiotic spindle asymmetry on female drive at two or three loci and explore how the evolution of these driver alleles differs under varying drive intensities and relative fitnesses.

            <p>This August, I was selected to present my research at the annual North Carolina State University Genetics and Genomics Academy conference. I have been conducting research as a member of the Guerrero Lab in the Department of Biological Sciences for over a year, and am in the beginning stages of producing a paper for publication about my work. I work with a postdoc faculty member in the lab, studying female meiotic drive, a mechanism that affects gene transmission in certain populations like maize and monkeyflowers. I specifically utilize Mathematica to write code to perform simulations across hundreds of thousands of generations to investigate how the female drive mechanism affects allele frequency in subsequent generations, under the hypothesis that the mechanism is also present in males. I use these simulations to garner more information about how allele frequencies in populations with this mechanism change over evolutionary time, and under what conditions dramatic changes occur.

            <p>Through this experience I learned a variety of valuable hard and soft skills that will help me throughout my future career. Developing a research poster helped me to better understand how to adapt research into a digestible format for consumption by both scientists and the general public. I also learned new skills with the software I use to do my research, Mathematica, like how to generate complex plots. In terms of soft skills, I felt that this experience was a great opportunity to help me develop my public speaking skills on a smaller scale, especially in regards to research. Research can be complex and difficult for me to translate into verbal format, but the repetitive nature of a poster presentation helped me to solidify my pitch, as well as answer questions on the spot from my viewers. I learned that I am capable of holding my own in research spaces where I may feel some imposter syndrome, especially as an undergraduate. I also learned that other researchers and scientists are not judgemental towards undergraduate research and in fact are very interested in what undergraduates are investigating. I was pleasantly surprised by the openness and support I felt from all of the faculty members and older students at the conference; everyone was very impressed with my research and took me seriously, despite being one of the youngest students presenting that day.

            <p>This experience at the Genetics and Genomics Academy conference will help me be better prepared for a career in science, specifically genetics. I feel more confident in my skills to present research, and I feel more confident in myself as a scientist that I do belong in academic spaces. I feel less intimidated by research now, and I would like to continue to pursue research as a medical school student after graduation. The skills I learned at the conference will be valuable as I pursue a career in medicine, where making science digestible for different audiences with different levels of scientific literacy is crucial to providing informed care. I will always remember this conference as a pivotal moment in my scientific career, and am grateful to my mentors, peers, and members of the Genetics and Genomics Academy for their contributions to my professional development.

            <p>My research is intended to culminate in a published paper, which my mentor and I expect to be completed by the end of this semester. I will be listed as co-first author, and will describe the findings of my research. We find a sizable increase in linkage disequilibrium among unlinked loci when male assortment is nonrandom, indicating a deviation in gamete haplotype frequencies in both sexes from Mendelian ratios. This is shown in the above contour plots, which show normalized linkage disequilibrium as contours at a range of heterozygote relative fitnesses (wH) and driver homozygote relative fitnesses (wG). Contour plots depict the difference in Dâ€™ between the nonrandom assortment case and the independent assortment case. We also find that male spindle asymmetry can affect the trajectory of allele frequencies in the population. Male spindle asymmetry increases the number of generations needed to reach equilibrium. In the nonrandom assortment case, the non-invading driver allele frequency decreases while the invading driver allele fixes. In the independent assortment case, the non-invading driver allele frequencies are unaffected. The strength of the effect on the non-invading driver allele frequency is more noticeable at stronger drive intensities. In the case of a two-locus system under strong drive intensity, we observe that the invading driver allele frequency surpasses that of the non-invading driver allele before reaching equilibrium.
