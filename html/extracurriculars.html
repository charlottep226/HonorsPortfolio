            <h2>This past October, I was hired as a Medical Assistant for Capital Primary Care by Dr. Ramesh Konduru. After applying to many jobs in the medical sphere and hearing back from very few of them, I was thrilled to see one day that Dr. Konduru wanted to hire me and was impressed by my grades, resume, and interview. I had been seeking a medical job because I knew I would be applying to medical school, so I wanted to gain some clinical experience while also confirming that I would enjoy being a physician and doing that type of work as a career. Since then, I have been working between 16 and 24 hours per week in the clinic rooming patients, taking vitals, and learning about the administration of a private practice. Each day that I work I have direct contact with over 30 patients in person, and countless others by phone. I chart their complaints, take medical histories, and record their weight, blood pressure, and other metrics of health. I then assist with scheduling the patient for their follow up appointments and send in any referrals to specialists that they may need. 
            </h2>
            <h2>Throughout my time at Capital Primary Care so far, I have had so many memorable interactions with patients, but these interactions do often come with challenges. One prominent challenge that I deal with on a daily basis is a language barrier. The physician at Capital Primary Care, Dr. Konduru, is a civil surgeon, and therefore can complete immigration physicals for the USCIS I-693 form that individuals need to establish immigration benefits. Many of our patients, as a result, are immigrants, and do not speak english. We do have one staff member who speaks Spanish, but other languages are not translatable by anyone in the office. I distinctly remember one patient that came to the office who was from France, and did not understand or speak any English. In order to get a medical history from her, and determine the reason for her appointment, I had to rely on her translator app and basic universal gestures. This made it challenging for me to go through the usual steps I would for an English speaking patient, and I will admit that my first instinct was to cut a few corners to save time to see the rest of our patients in the waiting room quicker. I quickly reminded myself, though, that this was likely just as difficult of a situation for the woman herself, being in an unfamiliar place where no one spoke her language. So, I decided to take some extra time with her, made sure I obtained patient consent in her native language before taking her vitals, and built a trusting relationship. Now, I see that patient frequently, and she always stops by to say hello to me before leaving the office. The challenges of patient care are what make these moments memorable and encouraging to me; I was able to succeed in these situations even when challenged, so I am confident that in the future I will be able to continue to succeed in patient care. 
                This job has given me incredible reassurance that I am pursuing the right career. I have wanted to go to medical school and be a doctor since I was a little girl, but I was always fearful that actually being in the medical field would not be as exciting to me as it seemed on television and in movies. Now that I have real experience with what it means to be in medicine, and a grasp on the daily life of a primary care physician, I know that this field is for me. I am much more confident now as I apply to medical school that this is my highest calling in life, and my nervousness has been replaced with excitement as I prepare to take the next step in my education towards becoming a physician.
