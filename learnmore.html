                When completing this Honors Portfolio, I wanted to approach the process in a way that would be valuable as I prepare to apply to medical school. As a result, the artifacts showcased on my website are sorted into the categories that an applicant like myself considers when developing a medical school application. I am currently completing the medical school application process for the 2025-2026 cycle, and this goal informed a large majority of the decisions that I made during my time at NC State. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                In addition to this approach, I also wanted to take the opportunity to use the portfolio itself as another impactful experience. I decided to create the website from scratch, so I learned html and css and began to explore website development. As someone with very limited coding experience, this was a novel challenge for me, but I wanted to use this experience to develop another new skill. I completed the website after much trial and error, but I now feel more confident in my ability to create websites, and more broadly learn computer programming skills.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The first section of artifacts on my website is coursework, or academics, where I demonstrate my ability to comprehend complex subjects, retain information that is presented at a fast pace, and apply my knowledge with high accuracy and sound reasoning. For this category, the first artifact I selected was the final research project I conducted in Advanced Genetics Laboratory. This is a required core class for the Genetics major at NC State, and aims to teach students more complex bench laboratory techniques through independent research. In this class each student developed their own individual hypothesis related to the broader research question being investigated by our professor, which was the role that the Single-minded gene plays in regulating metabolism. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The hypothesis that I investigated during this semester was that increased UPD2 expression in UAS-TNT/sim-GAL4 flies compared to wild type Canton S flies upregulates activation of the JAK/STAT pathway leading to increased Stat92E expression. I became familiar with many laboratory techniques during the semester, including quantitative PCR, RNA extraction, and fruit fly husbandry. After completing my experiments, I performed data analysis to elucidate that my hypothesis was in fact supported, and that Stat92E expression did increase in UAS-TNT/sim-GAL4 flies compared to wild type Canton S flies. I was then able to write up these results in a final research paper and a presentation that I gave to my class. Select slides from the presentation are shown on my website and are able to be clicked through. This experience helped me develop my bench laboratory skills, which will be necessary for medical school as well as helpful in other endeavors, such as shadowing and additional research. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Another coursework artifact that I selected for my portfolio was the final project I completed for Human Biomedical Genetics. I absolutely loved this class, which helped me to confidently cement my career goals in human genetics. This class involved a series of presentations during “Human Disease Day”, where the entire class period consisted of mini-lectures given by each student. I presented my lecture on hypermobile Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, a poorly understood genetic condition that disproportionately affects young women. This project allowed me to collaborate with a renowned Ehlers Danlos researcher, Dr. Courtney Gensemer, who happened to be visiting NC State during the time I was completing this project. I was able to conference with her, make connections, and learn about medical research programs that I am interested in pursuing while in medical school. I have included a slide from the presentation on my website that depicts the multiple genetic mutations that have been identified for different Ehlers Danlos subtypes, which were collected partially in collaboration with Dr. Gensemer. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The third artifact included on my website under the coursework section is a snippet of a final exam from one of my Chinese classes. This artifact is intended to display my language competency in both English and Mandarin Chinese, in which I am pursuing a minor. My Chinese Studies minor, being in a college very different from my Genetics major, has allowed me a unique opportunity to develop both my scientific skills and my skills in the humanities, which I believe will enhance my ability to provide compassionate, culturally sensitive, humanitarian care as a healthcare provider. This program has given me an interdisciplinary lens through which to view my science coursework, and has provided me with a chance to continue learning a subject I am passionate about. I also believe that this will help me stand out to admissions officers as I apply to medical school, and improve my chances of being admitted. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The next artifact on the coursework page of my portfolio is my independent research requirement. For the Genetics program at NC State, each student must complete their choice of either a teaching or research project. I chose research, which involved 135 hours of sustained independent research over the course of a semester. My research involved using Mathematica to model population dynamics with meiotic drive under specific variable conditions. This research was extremely technical, very computer-heavy, and difficult for me having very little coding experience. This experience taught me about my own ability to persevere and put in the required amount of hard work when necessary, as I spent many late nights working on code or on writing my paper in addition to my regular class load and extracurriculars. This project was one of the most difficult projects I have done to date, but I received a 98 on the final paper, which reassured me that I can do difficult things when I set my mind to complete them. I also became more confident in my ability to manipulate data with code and create models, and showed me the importance of being computer literate in medicine. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The final artifact included on the coursework page is my project from my Race, Membership, and Eugenics honors seminar. In this class, we were assigned a group project where we had to identify an issue centering around historically black colleges and universities, interview current HBCU students on the topic, and combine all of our research and interviews into a video and print media piece. My group decided to do our project on gun violence on and around HBCU campuses, and how negative stereotypes, lack of federal funding, and the pervasive issue of gun violence negatively shapes the education space for many black students when compared with their white counterparts at predominantly white institutions. This project was very eye opening and allowed me to gain experience having hard conversations about social issues with members of minority groups, while also educating me about gun violence and HBCU history. These skills will all be valuable as I enter a field that is very socially charged, and will help me be a more aware and anti-racist physician.

                The next category page on my website details my research experience during my undergraduate years at NC State. This is paid research experience that I have gained not through a course requirement, but through my position as a research assistant in the Guerrero Lab. The first element on this page gives an overview of the research that I have been focused on since the beginning of my sophomore year. I conduct population genetics research focused on female meiotic drive, which is the preferential inheritance of alleles in a population due to specific cellular machinery imbalances during meiosis, a specific type of cell division. I have been investigating if this machinery is also present in males, which has been hypothesized in the literature in the past, how it would affect population dynamics for a two locus system under different conditions such as altered fitness levels for each allele or altered drive intensity coefficients. This research heavily involves computerized modeling and simulation work, which I have learned to perform using the software Mathematica. With the collaboration of a postdoctoral researcher in the lab, I have been able to learn Mathematica with no prior experience using programming language, generate results for specific scenarios based on the literature, and display these results graphically and on poster presentations. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The second element of my research page details my experience presenting my research at NC State’s annual Genetics and Genomics Academy conference. This was a high impact experience for me during my time at NC State, teaching me about scientific conferences, providing experience presenting my research, and developing connections with faculty and other students that has been helpful in my career. Through this experience I was invited to join various other research groups to consult on issues pertaining to the research I had done, and I now feel much more confident in presenting complex research topics to a variety of audiences. Since the successful poster presentation, my Principle Investigator, postdoctoral mentor, and I have been focused on polishing my research for publication. The third element of the research page on my website details this process, which is still in-progress, but will be complete by the time I graduate from NC State. This paper will be a great achievement for me academically as I will be listed as a co-first author, as well as a great tool to showcase my ability to perform research, write academically, and collaborate with others as I apply to medical school. Publishing a research paper has always been a dream of mine since I was a child, so I consider this to be one of the most profound experiences of my undergraduate career. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The final page of artifacts on my website is extracurricular activities. In my last year at NC State, I have had a lesser classload than in previous years, so I have been able to focus on career-developing extracurricular activities that have confirmed my career goals and developed my skills outside of the classroom. One of these is my job as a medical assistant at a primary care and geriatrics office here in Raleigh. I have had the opportunity to work as a medical assistant since October of 2024, and I have learned a number of skills that will certainly help me in my pursuit of medicine. In this role I have direct patient contact, where I take vitals, medical history, complaints, medication lists, perform electrocardiograms and ankle-brachial indexes, and assist with administrative tasks such as insurance claims and USCIS I-693 forms for immigration into the United States. This job lets me interact daily with an enormous variety of people, as well as a number of vulnerable populations, which will allow me to approach my future patients with confidence and empathy. This position also confirmed for me that I do want to pursue being a doctor after I graduate, and that I do truly have a passion for the career and for service. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The second artifact of my extracurricular activities I chose is my summer internship with Pfizer Global Supply. I was offered this position after attending the College of Sciences Career Fair, which in and of itself confirmed for me the importance of attending these events. At Pfizer, I worked in package engineering focused on artwork chargebacks to international markets. This work was very different from everything I’ve been exposed to in the sciences and was a truly valuable experience to see what a corporate career in the pharmaceutical industry would entail. The most important part of this internship to me, however, was to again confirm that medicine is the career in which I belong. I have always heard that being a physician is such a demanding career that if you see yourself doing anything else, you should, but I found myself quickly bored of corporate life and still craving a career in medicine. This experience pushed me further into medicine and encouraged me to continue to seek out opportunities that would help to hone my goals. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The next artifact on the extracurriculars page is my leadership role as Vice President of Service and Outreach for the NC State Genetics Club. I have been a member of the Genetics Club since freshman year, and ran for a leadership position last year. I have always felt like a natural leader, so I was excited to fill this role. As VP of Service and Outreach, I organize service events for the club, which are required for our members. This has allowed me to develop strong community connections outside of NC State’s campus with local elementary schools, special needs organizations, and educational foundations. This role has helped me to foster my passion for service while also expanding my network and having a local community impact. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The final artifact on my extracurriculars page is shadowing a pediatric geneticist at Duke University. I recently began this experience, and I was instantly enthralled with the daily life of a medical geneticist. This experience has been the most impactful of all of the ones listed on my website, because it was the one that led me to truly see myself in the career that I am so passionate about. I will continue to shadow throughout the rest of this semester, which I hope brings more confirmation that a career in medicine is meant for me. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I would recommend the University Honors Program to incoming students at NC State. For me, the most impactful experience from the Honors Program was living in the Honors Village during my first-year, where I met many of my best friends. The network and opportunities that came from being physically surrounded by other honors students during my first year on campus helped to set me up with a strong, motivated friend group and great faculty connections which facilitated my success during my undergraduate career. I also had great experiences with the honors seminars that I took, most notably Race, Membership, and Eugenics. These courses helped to expand my worldview, while also simply getting a break from my strictly scientific coursework that I typically pursued for my degree. Finally, I feel that completing this portfolio helped me to consolidate all of the impactful experiences from my undergraduate years, which will be useful as I complete medical school applications. I feel proud of my accomplishments when I see everything in this format and it becomes much easier to write about these experiences after reflecting.
