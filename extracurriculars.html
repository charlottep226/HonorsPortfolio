            <p>This past October, I was hired as a Medical Assistant for Capital Primary Care by Dr. Ramesh Konduru. After applying to many jobs in the medical sphere and hearing back from very few of them, I was thrilled to see one day that Dr. Konduru wanted to hire me and was impressed by my grades, resume, and interview. I had been seeking a medical job because I knew I would be applying to medical school, so I wanted to gain some clinical experience while also confirming that I would enjoy being a physician and doing that type of work as a career. Since then, I have been working between 16 and 24 hours per week in the clinic rooming patients, taking vitals, and learning about the administration of a private practice. Each day that I work I have direct contact with over 30 patients in person, and countless others by phone. I chart their complaints, take medical histories, and record their weight, blood pressure, and other metrics of health. I then assist with scheduling the patient for their follow up appointments and send in any referrals to specialists that they may need. 
            </p>
            <p>Throughout my time at Capital Primary Care so far, I have had so many memorable interactions with patients, but these interactions do often come with challenges. One prominent challenge that I deal with on a daily basis is a language barrier. The physician at Capital Primary Care, Dr. Konduru, is a civil surgeon, and therefore can complete immigration physicals for the USCIS I-693 form that individuals need to establish immigration benefits. Many of our patients, as a result, are immigrants, and do not speak english. We do have one staff member who speaks Spanish, but other languages are not translatable by anyone in the office. I distinctly remember one patient that came to the office who was from France, and did not understand or speak any English. In order to get a medical history from her, and determine the reason for her appointment, I had to rely on her translator app and basic universal gestures. This made it challenging for me to go through the usual steps I would for an English speaking patient, and I will admit that my first instinct was to cut a few corners to save time to see the rest of our patients in the waiting room quicker. I quickly reminded myself, though, that this was likely just as difficult of a situation for the woman herself, being in an unfamiliar place where no one spoke her language. So, I decided to take some extra time with her, made sure I obtained patient consent in her native language before taking her vitals, and built a trusting relationship. Now, I see that patient frequently, and she always stops by to say hello to me before leaving the office. The challenges of patient care are what make these moments memorable and encouraging to me; I was able to succeed in these situations even when challenged, so I am confident that in the future I will be able to continue to succeed in patient care. 
                This job has given me incredible reassurance that I am pursuing the right career. I have wanted to go to medical school and be a doctor since I was a little girl, but I was always fearful that actually being in the medical field would not be as exciting to me as it seemed on television and in movies. Now that I have real experience with what it means to be in medicine, and a grasp on the daily life of a primary care physician, I know that this field is for me. I am much more confident now as I apply to medical school that this is my highest calling in life, and my nervousness has been replaced with excitement as I prepare to take the next step in my education towards becoming a physician.

                In the summer of 2024, I completed an internship at Pfizer in the packaging engineering department.  Initially I attended the College of Sciences Career Fair, where I met a recruiter for Pfizer and submitted my resume. I was quickly contacted for an interview and then offered the job, which taught me to take advantage of every opportunity to connect with companies. At Pfizer, I completed a project focused on artwork chargebacks to international markets. This project took the cost that it takes to destroy a piece of artwork, such as the packaging for a drug, and charged the cost back to the market from which the artwork came, instead of Pfizer eating the cost itself. This project ended up being a very large endeavor which was estimated to save Pfizer hundreds of thousands of dollars in the future. At the end of summer, I presented this project to the site Vice President, where we met in person and was able to connect with her. This work was very different from everything I’ve been exposed to in the sciences and was a truly valuable experience to see what a corporate career in the pharmaceutical industry would be like. At the beginning, I was enticed by the job, because the work was not as intellectually rigorous and was truly a welcome break from the complex science that I am used to, however I quickly realized that I crave the challenge of complex medical material. The most important part of this internship to me was that it confirmed for me that medicine is still the career that I want above all else. I feel confident now in that decision after having truly immersed myself in a job that I could have committed to for the rest of my life, and finding that it did not fill me with the same satisfaction as medicine does.

            <p>As the Vice President of Service and Outreach for the NC State Genetics Club, I am responsible for coordinating service events for our members. We participate in a variety of events around Raleigh, and each one has allowed me to connect with community members and broaden my network while giving back to the community itself. One of them is Darwin Day at the North Carolina Museum of Science, where we host a station set up for children to demonstrate the different adaptations of Darwin’s finches. We use clothespins to model the beaks of the birds, and various marbles and small objects like rocks and seeds to act as food. Each “beak” can only pick up the same size of object as “food”, which teaches children that Darwin’s finches have different sized beaks to adapt to their unique diets. Another event that our club participates in is Washington Elementary Science Night. This night is an event hosted by the elementary school to teach young children about STEM. We also are planning for this semester to participate in Reach for the Stars, which is an event to encourage students with special needs to pursue STEM, and have already donated homemade Valentine’s cards to the local children’s hospital. This role has given me a great opportunity to give back to my community and gain more experience working with vulnerable populations, which will certainly be helpful in a career in medicine. </p>

            <p>I recently began shadowing a pediatric geneticist at Duke University, and it has already proven to be the most impactful experience of all the ones featured in this portfolio. From the moment I stepped into the clinic, I was so captivated by the daily life of a medical geneticist that I immediately knew that this was the career that I needed to pursue. This hands-on experience has allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the field and has solidified my passion for pursuing a career in genetics. Above I have included a diagram of the genetic disorder with which I followed this geneticist diagnose a patient. In that moment reviewing the case I not only learned so much about the biological nature of the disease, but the doctor specifically mentioned some more nuanced lessons to me. One of the most impactful things that I will remember for the rest of my career is the importance of weighing a person’s quality of life with their disease prognosis. As medical professionals, I believe that we can quickly become hyper focused on curing a disease, and ignore the truth that the patient is a full, conscious person whose quality of life matters most. In this patient, for example, the clinical recommendation for their disorder is a ketogenic diet free of all sugars and carbs. This initially seems like good news, but once I considered that the patient was a child with siblings who would want to celebrate birthdays eating cake or spend summer afternoons eating watermelon or grapes, I realized that the clinical recommendation wasn’t what was actually going to be beneficial for the patient. In this case, the doctor I followed opted for a medicinal treatment instead, in order to preserve the patient’s quality of life. As I continue shadowing throughout the rest of the semester, I am hopeful that this experience will further affirm that a career in medicine is the right path for me, and continue to teach me these valuable lessons about patient care.
